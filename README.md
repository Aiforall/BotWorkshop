# Build a Bot with Zero Code

## Intro
In this tutorial we will build a chatbot using Microsoft Azure services, and this can be done with zero or minimum code developement. You could run this tutorial on your own (and tackle one "role" at a time), or (preferred) as a part of the team of 2-3 people. 

There are three main steps in creating a knowledge bot:

## Brainstorming

You can start brainstorming your ideas with your team (or on your own) and ideally decide on the following below, before you start "building" the chatbot.
- Bot Name: __________
- Business challenge: __________ 
- Target audience: __________ 
- Bot personality: __________ 

## Team roles & responsibilities

- The Architect:
  - Creates the structure of the bot
  - Connects the knowledgebase to the web app and  to external sources to chat. 
  - No technical knowledge is required, but will need to follow specific steps. 
- The Curator(s):
  - Oversee all the bot knowledge on QnA Maker. 
  - This includes creating all the content for questions and answers.
- The Parent:
  - Needs to make sure that the right emotional positing and personality of the bot comes through in the answers.

### The Architect
You are going to get the team started, later you will connect the Knowledge QnAMaker to The Web App Bot to test the bot in a connected chat environment. We are going to walk through the steps to get everything ready.

Please review [this document](https://github.com/galiya/BotWorkshop/assets/documents/Architect.docx) and the support team are here to guide you if you need any help.

### The Curator(s)
Your role is to build the questions and answers that make up the conversational experience, you will work closely with the Parent to ensure the personality of the bot is represented. The Architect will get you setup.

### The Parent
Your role is to work closely with the Curator to ensure the personality of the bot is in the answers. You could either edit the answers the Curator has created or you can create in partnership, whichever is easier for you both. The Architect will get you setup.
