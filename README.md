# Build a Bot with Zero Code

## Intro
In this tutorial we will build a chatbot using Microsoft Azure services, and this can be done with zero or minimum code developement. You could run this tutorial on your own (and tackle one "role" at a time), or (preferred) as a part of the team of 2-3 people. 

There are three main steps in creating a knowledge bot:

## Team roles & responsibilities

- The Architect:
  - Creates the structure of the bot
  - Connects the knowledgebase to the web app and  to external sources to chat. 
  - No technical knowledge is required, but will need to follow specific steps. 
- The Curator(s):
  - Oversee all the bot knowledge on QnA Maker. 
  - This includes creating all the content for questions and answers.
- The Parent:
  - Needs to make sure that the right emotional positing and personality of the bot comes through in the answers.

### The Architect
You are going to get the team started, later you will connect the Knowledge QnAMaker to The Web App Bot to test the bot in a connected chat environment. We are going to walk through the steps to get everything ready.
